# SF Transit Bart and Muni Applet for Tidbyt

Displays predicted arrival times for configurable stops for both Muni and Bart at the same time. Now you can decide which stop to head to at a glance when you are leaving the house.

Estimates comes from the [NextBus](https://www.nextbus.com) API for [San Francisco Muni](https://www.sfmta.com/) and the [Bart Legacy API](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/api) for [Bart](https://www.bart.gov/).

There are are few configuration options:
* Set both a bart station and muni stop
* Hide arrival times below a certain number of minutes (so you have time to get there)
